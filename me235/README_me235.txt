README: ME 235 Spring 2018
Andrew P. Sabelhaus

This folder will contain examples of code we'll use in the tutorials for ME235.
In particular, we'll be doing things like UART communication using interrupts,
setting PWM blocks, and providing examples for e.g. RC servo communication.
We'll show the use of header files, and by using this repository, version control!

All projects are licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, meaning that you'll
have to be explicit about what code you use in your final project.
You can use these examples! But, if you do use them or adapt them in any way,
it's not enough to just copy and paste the text and say "Thanks Drew!"
The relevant sections of the Apache 2.0 license are in section 4, which reads:

***************************

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

Basically, keep the license file ("LICENSE" in the root directory of this repository)
as well as the little introductions I have to the source files.
